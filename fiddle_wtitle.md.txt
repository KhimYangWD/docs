title: Propagate Fiddle Leaf Fig
---
## Prerequisites:
-   Clean garden shears.
-   Rooting hormone.
-   Vase with about 5 inches of clean water.

Propagating fiddle leaf figs is a good way to get new plants from a healthy existing plant. You can propagate fiddle leaf fig plants by taking cuttings from the ends of fiddle leaf fig branches and placing them in water. To expedite the rooting process, you can dip the ends of the cuttings in rooting hormones.

1.  Select a good location to cut the branch. Consider:

    -   Where you want the tree to branch out as the plant will sprout new branches from the node right below the cut.
    -   The cuttings should be at least 12 inches long with multiple leaves on it.
2.  Using a clean garden shear, cut the branch or stalk. If the plant is really tall with a single stalk, you can take multiple cuttings from a single stalk and propagate all of them.

3.  Remove the lower leaves from the cuttings, leaving just 1-3 leaves on top. This will encourage the cuttings to focus their energy on growing roots.

4.  \(Optional\) Dip the cuttings in rooting hormone, then place them in the vase with water.

5.  Change the water every 4-5 days to keep the water clean.

6.  After 2-4 weeks, you will see white stubs or roots grow out from nodes on the portions of the cuttings submerged in water.

7.  When the roots are about 2-3 inches long, transfer the new plants to a gallon-size pot filled with well-drained soil.


You should have new fiddle leaf fig plants to transplant to a pot in about two months. The original branches or stalks where you took the cuttings from will also sprout new branches, giving you a bushier looking "tree".

Place the new plant near a window that gets maximum indirect sunlight. Rotate the plant occasionally to promote even growth, but avoid relocating the plant too frequently. Water with 2 cups of water once a week. Wipe the leaves with a soft clean cloth every few weeks to increase sun absorption. Fertilize only occasionally.

**Note:** Fiddle leaf figs don't like water-logged soil. Water only when the top 2 inches of soil is bone dry to prevent over-watering.
